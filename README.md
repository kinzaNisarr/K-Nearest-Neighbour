# Diabetes Predictor: A Machine Learning Approach with k-Nearest Neighbors

## Project Overview
This project applies the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to a diabetes dataset for predicting diabetic conditions based on various health metrics. The goal is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in medical diagnostics.

## Features
- Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using scikit-learn.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing including scaling and encoding.
- Evaluation of model performance with confusion matrix and classification report.
- Streamlined pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains health-related metrics such as age, gender, blood test results (Urea, Creatinine, HbA1c, Cholesterol, etc.), and BMI. The 'CLASS' attribute indicates the health status of the patients.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
